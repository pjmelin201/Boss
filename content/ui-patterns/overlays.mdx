## Overview

Overlays can streamline the interface by allowing extra content to be disclosed as needed. Overlays create a new modality to the user, and can facilitate the completion of individual tasks.

### Keep overlays simple

Overlays are meant to be interacted in a single context. Avoid creating a whole page inside an overlay. Prefer single-column layouts that convey a clear goal from the moment the overlay is opened.

However, overlays are powerful tools when creating space for single-context interfaces. When designing a new feature to support a main interface, start by considering if the new feature can be created under a single context. 

If the answer is yes, designing the feature inside an overlay provides an easy way to add responsive support, and avoid deeper navigations. If the answer is no, or if a side navigation is required for the feature, consider designing a new page.

### Trigger elements and overlay states

Overlays are initially hidden, but can be opened by an element with `role="button"` or `role="combobox"`, called **trigger**. The role `button` allows the **trigger** to be a relativelly complex element, such as a list item. The role `combobox` allows the trigger to be a form input that uses an overlay to present suggestions or autocomplete options.

<!-- TODO: talk about autocomplete overlays

Overlays can also be opened by interaction with form elements -->

### Ensure overlays are accessible

Overlays should be fully functional using the keyboard and assistive technology. Pressing `Esc` should dismiss an overlay, returning focus to the **trigger** that opened it.

### Overlays should work well on any device

Overlays must adjust their designs to fit in smaller viewports. Make sure the overlay contents work with all supported sizes and input methods.

### Overlay URLs

Generally, simple overlays won't have a URL. Specialized overlays such as alerts, simple dialogs, or confirmation dialogs are not candidates for URLs. 

However, overlays containing navigation menus or forms can have their own URLs to facilitate user navigation and logic flow on narrow viewports.

<!--

Todo:

---SPLIT PAGE LAYOUT: These types of Overlays can be placed in a pane region of a page on regular viewports. And can be displayed as fullscreen Overlays on narrow viewports.---

Note: *It was decided that only overlays that are actual overlays on regular or on narrow viewports can have a URL. The above case is resolved by the split page layout.*

<Caption>Anatomy of an overlay.</Caption>

### Overlay regions

- header
- actions
- subheader
- body
- footer

### Scroll behavior

The **body** region may scroll vertically to accommodate lists and contents too long to fit in the available space, or when the overlay appears in a small screen.

### Spacing

Keep the edges of an overlay free of text and heavy visuals. This breathing room is meant to visually distinguish the overlay as an elevated surface, alongside its shadow. Use a safe area of 16px when rendering content. Inner components that have transparent or discrete backgrounds may bleed into the padding for visual alignment.

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293280/174925634-603a27cf-2281-4a3a-9078-d1b8138e0d09.png" width="960" />
<Caption>

  2. Close button placed `8px` away from the edges. Note that the "Ã—" glyph remains within the safe area.<br />
  3. Action list items in the Body region.<br />
  4. Footer buttons always appear inside the safe area. <br />
</Caption>

### Backdrop

An overlay can have a visual **backdrop** element. The **backdrop** dims the rest of the page to emphasize the active overlay. It appears when an overlay is centered on the page, or attached to the sides.

By default, clicking on the **backdrop** will dismiss the overlay. However, if the overlay contains a form that can have unsaved changes, the **backdrop** won't dismiss the overlay, regardless of the state of the form.

<!--
Todo:
(discuss more about form states and forms that can be closed by the backdrop)
-->

### Header region

A **header** region is used to provide the context of the overlay. By default, the region supports a title, description, and a close button.

**Headers** are required when the overlay has a [`role="dialog"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role). In that case, a title must be provided even if it is not visually displayed. The close button must always be visible. 
<!-- _(see Dialog component documentation)_ -->

Titles and descriptions wrap to multiple lines if necessary. <!-- Todo: (discuss about custom headers with examples) -->

Variants of the **header** region:

### Dimensions

Overlays should never extend beyond the viewport sizes, and may resize to fit smaller devices. The contents of an overlay should fit narrow viewports with a minimum width of `320px`. If the contents of an overlay extend vertically beyond the specified height, the **body** region will scroll.

Overlays width and height properties support the following values:

<Grid gridTemplateColumns={['1fr', null, null, null, 'auto 1fr']} gridGap={4}>
<div>

| Width     | Size               |
| :-------- | :----------------- |
| `auto`    | Adjusts to content |
| `xsmall`  | 192px              |
| `small`   | 256px              |
| `medium`  | 320px              |
| `large`   | 480px              |

</div>
</Grid>

## Behaviors

### Opening

Overlays can be opened by a direct user interaction with a **trigger**. If they have an associated URL and the URL is accessed by the user, they appear already open on page load.

### Dismissing

Users should be able to dismiss an overlay by:

- Pressing `Esc`
- Pressing the **Close** button, if present
- Clicking outside, if allowed
- Pressing the browserâ€™s back button, if it has an associated URL

<!-- TODO: review the following text -->
<!-- Close buttons are useful as an easy escape route, particularly in larger or more complex overlays, or when the overlay is no longer visually connected to the source that triggered it. Always use a close button for overlays with backdrops.

Users may click or tap outside to dismiss an overlay. Larger overlays with backdrops may opt to disable this functionality in dangerous scenarios where the user could lose progress or data accidentally.

If the overlay contains changes that are not immediately applied (such as in a form), provide footer buttons such as **Save**, **Apply**, or **Submit**. To avoid users from losing important unsaved changes, a [`beforeUnload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload) event may be used.

Users should also be able to click or tap the browserâ€™s back button to dismiss the overlay. This is particularly useful on mobile devices. -->

## Placement

Overlays may appear:

- Anchored next to its **trigger** element
- Centered in the viewport with a backdrop
- As a sliding side sheet with a backdrop

On narrow viewports, overlays can be one of the options above, or adapt to variants that are designed specifically for smaller devices:

- Bottom sheet (anchored to the bottom of the screen for easier touch reachability)
- Full-screen (for forms, long lists and other complex flows)

<!-- Overlays that contain input fields or other controls that require a keyboard should appear as full screen on narrow viewports. -->

### Anchored overlays

Anchored overlays can be used in any device or screen size. They are placed next to the **trigger**, drawing a direct connection between the elements. The source element should have a "selected" visual state while the overlay is opened.

Anchored overlays are useful for menus, quick interactions, and data manipulation. They don't dim the rest of the screen with a backdrop when presented.

<!-- Anchored overlays can be dismissed at any time by clicking outside of it. An anchored overlay may also be dismissed after choosing one of its options or buttons, or when clicking on an optional **Close** button. -->

</Caption>

### Centered overlays ("dialogs")

Centered overlays appear centered in the viewport, with a visible backdrop that dims the rest of the window for focus.

Centered overlays should always have an overlay header with a title and **Close** button.

<!-- Prevent page scrolling when a centered overlay is present. -->

Overlays shouldn't touch the viewport edges. Use a safe 16px margin to keep centered overlays visually distinct from the rest of the page, even on narrow viewports.

<!-- Simple and small centered overlays can remain as-is on narrow viewports. Consider <a href="#responsive-variants">responsive variants</a> as more elements are added to it. -->

### Side sheets

Side sheets slide from the right or left edges of the viewport. Left side sheets are reserved for global navigation drawers. Right side sheets are used for global actions, but can also be considered for quick previews in full-width pages, or configuration panels.

Side sheets take the entire height of the viewport, and should be used sparingly. Don't use side sheets to present forms or flows that should be a page instead.

## Responsive variants

### Bottom sheets (specific to narrow viewports)

A bottom sheet is a variant supported on narrow viewports made to facilitate reachability. Overlays that appear anchored or centered in large screens may adapt to appear as a bottom sheet on small screens.

A bottom sheet variant can be used when the overlay content is too busy to appear anchored. A bottom sheet always dims the rest of the screen for focus. Tapping on the backdrop dismisses the overlay.

Its height should always accommodate the content inside. If the content is too tall to fit in the viewport, the content region should scroll accordingly.

On portrait mode, a bottom sheet takes up the full width of the viewport.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293280/176796465-dfe0b5ad-318a-4f3b-a724-6a2b0b02bebb.png" alt="" />
<Caption>

In order to work well in non-rectangular mobile screens and browser UI, bottom sheets may add extra padding inside the overlay, following [`env(safe-area-inset-*)`](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env()>) environment variables.

</Caption>

On landscape mode, a bottom sheet has a maximum width of 480px, centered horizontally.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293280/176796466-8e61476f-5206-4d73-97cf-796c8f8653df.png" alt="" />
<Caption>Bottom sheet on landscape viewports.</Caption>

### Full-screen (specific to narrow viewports)

Full-screen overlays may be used to present content that needs all the available space on narrow viewports.

Overlays that have one or more input fields should always use the full-screen variant.
