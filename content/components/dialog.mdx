## Overview

A dialog is a floating window which separates a user from the action they were
taking to present them with some information they _must_ interact with, before
they can return to the previous action. This is useful for streamelining
actions (such as presenting forms to create new entities, or asking for
disambiguation) or for confirming actions (such as confirming to delete).

They generally allow the user to focus on a quick task without having to
navigate across pages.
