## Usage

Use a button group to visually group a set of closely related buttons. You may mix [button variants](/components/button#color) in one button group, but see the [best practices](#best-practices) for limitations.

Grouping buttons with a button group is better than rendering buttons close together for the following uses:

- grouping a set of closely related buttons with other less related buttons
- grouping multiple sets of buttons
- saving horizontal space when rendering multiple closely-related buttons

### Best practices

- Avoid grouping too many buttons together. It could be overwhelming to the user.
- Do not use a button group to indicate a selection. Use a [segmented control](/components/segmented-control) instead.
- Do not use a button group as a relacement for tab navigation. <!-- TODO: link to TabNav once it's merged -->
- Avoid mixing buttons with text labels with icon-only buttons. However, it is acceptable to group a text-labeled button with an icon-only button with a [down-pointing triangle](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons/triangle-down-16) that opens a dropdown menu of actions related to the button.
- Do not group an [invisible](/components/button#invisible) button with buttons of another variant.
- Do not put multiple [primary](/components/button#priamry) buttons in a single button group.

## Accessibility

A button group does not behave like a [toolbar](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/toolbar_role), so assistive technologies still interpret the buttons as unrelated. The grouping is purely visual.
